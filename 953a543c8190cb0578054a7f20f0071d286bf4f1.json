  "content_text": "Philippines investigating US authorities barring seafarers from entryPhilippines investigating US authorities barring seafarers from entry\nNearly 100 Filipino crew had been deported from the US by mid-year according to figures from the Philippines government.\nThe Philippines Embassy in the US has sought answers from the US authorities over a growing number of cases of its seafarers being denied entry and deported.\nIn a statement issued on 22 October the embassy said it had engaged with government agencies including the US State Department and the Department of Homeland Security over reports of denial of entry at ports in the US in recent months.\n\"It has been informed that the denial of entry for the concerned seafarers was done in accordance with existing US laws, regulations and policies,\" the embassy said.\nThe embassy said it would continue engaging with the US agencies over denial of entry for Filipino seafarers. The statement gave no details of the cases involved.\nIn July the International Seafarers Action Center strongly condemned the “unjust and inhumane” treatment of more than 100 Filipino seafarers between April and July this year by the US immigration authorities.\nIt cited the case of 21 crew members arrested from the Carnival Sunshine cruise ship at the Port of Norfolk in Virginia where it said the seafarers held valid C-1/D visas and were not granted due process. The crew were reportedly accused of possessing child pornography but according to the Center no evidence was presented. The seafarers were deported without charge and barred from re-entering the US for 10 years.\nThe US Embassy said the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) had previously stated its readiness to provide assistance to affected seafarers.\nThe Philippines Star newspaper reported that during a Philippines Senate hearing in August, Migrant Works Undersecretary Bernard Olalia said that at least 93 Filipino seafarers have been deported by the US government as of mid-2025.\nThe official said the seafarers, “were ever arrested for having in possession of child-pornographic materials. No cases were filed against them.”\nAt press conference held by the National Council of Churches in the Philippines in Quezon City on 20 October seafarers said they had been forcibly removed from vessels by US Customs and Border Patrol officers and made to sign documents for “voluntary withdrawal” of their US visas.\nAbout the Author\nYou May Also Like",
