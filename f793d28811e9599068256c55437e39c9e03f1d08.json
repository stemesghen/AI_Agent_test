  "content_text": "Cruise Ship Rescues 63 People From Overcrowded Sailboat In The Ionian Sea\nA Norwegian Cruise Line vessel rescued 63 people from an overcrowded sailboat in the Ionian Sea on 22 October, after responding to a distress call coordinated by the Hellenic Coast Guard.\nThe Norwegian Epic, a 155,873-gross-ton cruise ship registered in the Bahamas, was en route from Civitavecchia, Italy, to Santorini, Greece, when the Unified Search and Rescue Coordination Centre of the Hellenic Coast Guard requested its assistance.\nThe vessel located the small sailboat approximately 65 nautical miles southwest of Zakynthos and diverted from its planned course to carry out the rescue.\nAccording to Norwegian Cruise Line, the rescued individuals were brought on board and provided with medical evaluations, food, water, and other necessary items.\nThe company stated that the ship acted under the directive of the Rescue Coordination Centre and proceeded to the Greek port of Kalamata, where the individuals were safely handed over to the authorities.\nGreek officials confirmed that the operation was completed successfully the next morning. It remains unclear whether the sailboat had issued a distress call or was spotted by one of the regular air and sea patrols conducted by Frontex, national coast guards, or charitable organisations in the region.\nPassengers onboard the Norwegian Epic shared that the vessel came to a sudden halt after the small boat was sighted, and that the rescue operation lasted several hours. Some reported that one of the ship’s tenders was used to approach the roughly 30-foot sailboat and transfer the individuals aboard.\nThose rescued were believed to be migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean, a route frequently associated with overcrowded and unsafe vessels. Once on board, they were given temporary shelter in a restricted area away from passengers until authorities took charge.\nUnder the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), all ships are legally required to assist anyone in distress at sea if it can be done without putting others at risk.\nThe humanitarian operation, however, led to changes in the cruise’s itinerary. The planned port call to Santorini on 23 October was cancelled, as Greek authorities directed the ship to Kalamata for the handover.\nThe Norwegian Epic resumed its voyage afterwards, making its next scheduled stop at Piraeus (Athens) on 24 October. The itinerary continues through Mykonos, Valletta, Syracuse, Salerno, Livorno, and Cannes before returning to Rome on 1 November.\nNorwegian Cruise Line expressed gratitude to its guests for their patience and understanding during the unplanned diversion.\nReferences: Cruisehive, AOL\n⚓️ Enhance Your Knowledge.
