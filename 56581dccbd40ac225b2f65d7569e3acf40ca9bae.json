  "content_text": "US to Deploy Aircraft Carrier Amidst Tensions with Venezuela\nPresident Donald Trump dramatically escalated a U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean on Friday by deploying the Gerald Ford aircraft carrier group to Latin America, a show of force that far exceeds any past counter-narcotics need and represents Washington’s most muscular move yet in the region.\nThe deployment is part of Trump's military buildup in the Caribbean, which includes eight additional warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft. It is likely to raise concern in the region about the Trump administration's intent.\nThe deployment marks a significant escalation amid heightened tensions with Venezuela, whose government Washington has long accused of harboring drug traffickers and undermining democratic institutions.\n\"The enhanced U.S. force presence in the USSOUTHCOM AOR will bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the Western Hemisphere,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell posted on X.\nHe did not specify when the carrier would be moving to the region, but as of a few days ago, the carrier was traveling via the Strait of Gibraltar and in Europe.\nThe Ford, which was commissioned in 2017, is the United States' newest aircraft carrier and the world's largest, with more than 5,000 sailors aboard.\nThe U.S. military has carried out 10 strikes against alleged drug vessels, mostly in the Caribbean, since early September, killing about 40 people. While the Pentagon has not given much information, it has said some of those killed were Venezuelan.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has repeatedly alleged that the U.S. is hoping to drive him from power.\nOn Thursday, Maduro warned that if the U.S. ever intervened in the country, \"the working class would rise and a general insurrectional strike would be declared in the streets until power is regained,\" adding that \"millions of men and women with rifles would march across the country.\"\nWashington in August doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50 million, accusing him of links to drug trafficking and criminal groups that Maduro denies.\nTensions between the United States and Venezuela's neighbor, Colombia, have also spiked in recent days, with Trump accusing Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an \"illegal drug leader\" and a \"bad guy\" - language Petro's government says is offensive.\n\"These forces will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle (transnational criminal organizations),\" Parnell said.\nTrump has authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations in Venezuela.\nINCREASING MILITARY BUILDUP\nTrump has said that his Republican administration plans to brief the U.S. Congress on operations against drug cartels and that even though he did not need a declaration of war, operations against cartels on land would be next.\nOn Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the latest strike against an alleged drug vessel killed six suspected \"narco-terrorists\" in the Caribbean.\nThe strikes have raised alarms among some legal experts and Democratic lawmakers, who question whether they adhere to the laws of war.\nLast week, Reuters was first to report that two alleged drug traffickers survived a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean. They were rescued and taken to a U.S. Navy warship before being repatriated to their home countries of Colombia and Ecuador.\nWith only 11 aircraft carriers in the U.S. military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.\nLast year, the USS George Washington deployed to South America, but that was scheduled well in advance and was part of an exercise.\nThe Ford carrier, which includes a nuclear reactor, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jets and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.\nIt has an arsenal of missiles, like the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile, a medium-range, surface-to-air missile used to counter drones and aircraft.\nThe Ford also includes sophisticated radars that can help control air traffic and navigation.\nThe supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.\n(Reuters)",
