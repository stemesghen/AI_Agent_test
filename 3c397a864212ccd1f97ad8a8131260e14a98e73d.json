  "content_text": "Disputes between owners and charterers over fuel quality have generated a steady income stream for marine lawyers over many decades. But the arrival of new fuels, a key component in shipping’s now disrupted decarbonisation drive, is generating a new category of disputes relating to VLSFO.\nDual-fuel LNG carriers, which operate mostly with LNG as fuel, also carry large volumes of VLSFO as a back-up. But the fuel, with a maximum sulphur content of 0.5%, can become unstable at sea. It may separate and even solidify in bunker tanks, becoming unusable. The risk escalates when VLSFO is stored on board for long periods.\nThe relatively new class of fuel risk is not limited to LNG carriers, however. Vessels designed to use methanol or ammonia as a primary fuel will also require significant quantities of VLSFO on board, both as pilot fuel and as an emergency back-up.\nThe risks are many and varied, affecting both hull and machinery insurers and P&I Clubs. And experts point out that as proactive owners and operators continue their quest for cleaner fuels, the scale of these fuel risks is only likely to rise.\nAnsuman Ghosh is Director of Engineering at the UK P&I Club and he is closely involved in the Club members’ fuel disputes, as well as the UK Defence Club which supports its members with legal assistance, advice, costs and litigation when necessary.\nTalking to Seatrade Maritime News recently, he cited a recent example of an LNG carrier with three separate VLSFO bunker stems on board – one had been on the ship for about two years; another for 18 months; and a third for almost a year. The VLSFO had become unstable, stratifying, with a sizeable volume solidifying in the bottom of bunker tanks.\nIncidents like these, he said, can cause damage to filters, purifiers, and engines. They also create a nightmare of extra work for seafarers who are the first to tackle issues such as cleaning pipes, unclogging filters, and clearing out tanks. These must, of course, be gas-freed, and a cleaning operation could involve a week or more of off-hire.\nOlder ships, Ghosh pointed out, have relatively few bunker tanks, creating further challenges in sorting out unstable fuel. However, newer ships come with more tanks for this reason, he said.\nMore diligent fuel management strategies are absolutely essential in today’s multi-fuel environment, he declared. Rigorous sampling and monitoring of fuels on board must be a fundamental component in safe and effective fuel management.\nThese fuel issues also generate another raft of disputes between owners and charterers. In a timecharter, for example, the charterer is responsible for supplying fuel and covering any costs associated with its use. However, in the event of VLSFO becoming unstable while stored on board over an extended period of several voyages, the charterer would likely argue that it had been tested and approved when the bunker stem was delivered. Therefore, if it was off-spec, it must be the fault of the shipowner.\nGhosh believes, therefore, that owners must adopt more proactive fuel management strategies, both at a practical level, and in legal agreements. Charterparties need to have new clauses addressing issues like fuel monitoring, the use of additives, regular testing, a requirement for not too much fuel heating, and so on.\nDespite delay at the IMO of the Net Zero Framework, the direction of travel remains unchanged and fuel disputes are likely to become more common, not less. The Club itself has a dynamic strategy: fuels are a key element in its Safety and Risk Management Division. It is the only P&I partner in the Methane Abatement in Maritime Innovation Initiative; it works closely with SEA-LNG; and it is also involved in projects involving carbon capture risk assessments.\nRead more about:\nIMOAbout the Author\nYou May Also Like",
