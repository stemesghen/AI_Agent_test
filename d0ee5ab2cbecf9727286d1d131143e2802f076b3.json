  "content_text": "U.S. Deploys World’s Largest Aircraft Carrier To Caribbean In Major Military Buildup\nThe United States has deployed the USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean in a major military buildup.\nOfficials say the move is meant to strengthen the US presence in the region and fight drug trafficking, but experts believe it also puts pressure on Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro.\nThe carrier strike group, stationed in Europe, was redirected by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to the US Southern Command area, covering the Caribbean, Central and South America.\nThe USS Gerald R Ford will join eight other US naval vessels already operating in the region, including a cruiser, a littoral combat ship, an amphibious assault ship, destroyers, and transport ships.\nThe nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2017, is over 1,100 feet long, and capable of carrying up to 90 aircraft. It displaces 100,000 tons and can reach speeds of up to 34.5 miles per hour. The carrier is expected to reach its operational position in the Caribbean in the coming days.\nOn 24 October, Pete Hegseth confirmed another strike on a vessel in the Caribbean linked to drug trafficking. This was the first overnight strike and reportedly killed all male narco-terrorists on board.\nSince last month, similar strikes have resulted in a total of 43 casualties. The US says these actions aim to disrupt illegal drug networks and enhance regional security.\nHowever, Venezuela has condemned the deployment. President Nicolás Maduro accused the US of fabricating a new war and warned against attempts to destabilise his government. Maduro reiterated his claim that anti-drug operations are being used as a cover for intervention.\nAnalysts say that Venezuela’s role in regional drug trafficking is relatively minor and suggest the military buildup may be intended as a show of force against Maduro.\nDr Christopher Sabatini, a Latin America expert, described the US strategy as sending a signal to intimidate Venezuela’s military and inner circle rather than preparing for a full-scale invasion.\nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly mentioned possible “land action” in Venezuela and discussed targeting cocaine facilities and trafficking routes.\nThe Pentagon insists current operations focus on counter-narcotics, but the scale of the deployment and the aircraft carrier’s capabilities suggest broader strategic intentions.\nThe US has also increased its air presence in the region, including over Puerto Rico. Officials said the additional forces will help dismantle transnational criminal networks.\nReferences: India Today, BBC\n⚓️ Enhance Your Knowledge. Prevent Accidents.
