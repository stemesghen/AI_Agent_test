So far, there have been about ten attacks, and nearly 40 people have been killed.\nThe Pentagon has provided only limited operational details about those attacks, but officials have said some strikes occurred near Venezuela.\nLegal experts and some lawmakers have expressed concern about the campaign, questioning whether the strikes comply with international law and the laws of war.\nPer reports, at least two people survived a prior strike and were rescued aboard a U.S. Navy ship before being repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador.\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has repeatedly accused the U.S. of attempting to remove him from power. U.S. officials have cited links between Maduro and drug trafficking, and in August Washington doubled the reward for information leading to his arrest to $50 million, a claim Maduro has denied.\nReference: Reuters\n⚓️ Enhance Your Knowledge.
